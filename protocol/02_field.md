# Field deployment/recovery protocol

## Personnel

- For each deployment/recovery, we have one person doing the deployment and another person being the scribe
- Dress appropriately for the site (bring or wear rubber boots provided in lab)


## Deployment/recovery

Go through the following for each deployment/recovery
1. Deploy a fresh AudioMoth unit and recover the previous one
2. Turn off the old AudioMoth (set switch to USB-OFF) and record the current time as the date and time recovered in the old AudioMoth's row in the field notebook datasheet 
3. Take a picture of the deployment (this provides the location and how the package is tied to the branches or rods)
4. Record the following fields in the NEW datasheet in the row with the correct AudioMoth Unit #:
    - Site
    - Deployer initial
    - Scribe initial
    - Notes: Useful for information not found in previous columns
      - Pattern: (Panasonic|Ikea) Batteries (Daytime|Nighttime) (0:00-24:00|3:00-13:30) UTC + additional info.
